# Jungle Devs - Django Challenge #001

## Description

**Challenge goal**: The purpose of this challenge is to give an overall understanding of a backend application. You’ll be implementing a simplified version of a news provider API. The concepts that you’re going to apply are:

- REST architecture;
- Authentication and permissions;
- Data modeling and migrations;
- PostgreSQL database;
- Query optimization;
- Serialization;
- Production builds (using Docker).

**Target level**: This is an all around challenge that cover both juniors and experience devs based on the depth of how the concepts were applied.

**Final accomplishment**: By the end of this challenge you’ll have a production ready API.
